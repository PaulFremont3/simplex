# simplex
This is a very, very simple IBM for simulating ecological communities, written in R.
It considers a community of N different populations, a stock of two nutrients, and an interaction matrix for trophic interactions.

__It is in a primordial phase!__

The repository is meant to help us to learn github and to optimize  sharing/maintaining the code.

## EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED, FAIL FASTER, LEARN FASTER ;)
